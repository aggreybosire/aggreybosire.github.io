Hi, my name is Aggrey, a software developer mainly interested in deep learning. 

I have been thinking about blogging for a while now. I know the benefits of putting work out there but I just couldn't seem to get off the block. Maybe I overthought it. I started one a while ago but it was never consistent. Hopefully, this one will come to fruition.

This blog will mostly cover deep learning topics. I intend to cover concepts and some machine learning projects from training to deployment.

I will write about the new things I learn. Sometimes putting things on paper gives you a better understanding of those things. It will act like my notebook; notes of things I'm currently working on or studying. Richard Feynman said If you can’t explain something in simple terms, you don’t understand it. 

This will act as my diary. I will dive deep into personal projects, past and present. It will acts as my portfolio to showcase some of my work and as a project building exercise.

I also intend to discuss some interesting machine learning research papers I am reading. In the process, I will implement a few of them.

I recently noticed that I not only need to deploy my models to web but also to mobile. But I have never worked on mobile apps. To fill this gap, I decided to learn a new programming language- Flutter for mobile(Both ios and android). Thanks [Edwin](https://twitter.com/edwinbosire) for the motivation. I hope to document the whole journey. I am looking forward to building some  interesting, intelligent apps.

Once in a while am going to talk about startups; the ones I tried, those that failed, what worked, what didn't work, startups I admire and lessons I have learned so far.

Finally, I am writing to pay my intellectual dept. I have learnt a great deal from numerous sources off-and-online and I owe it to myself to pay back. There are numerous people out here whose journey is similar to mine, probably at different stages. Some starters, some more experienced. If this blog helps you understand a concept, that's a win. If it somehow connects us, through projects, consulting and business, thats a plus win.

I am really excited about doing this.
