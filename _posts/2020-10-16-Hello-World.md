Hi, my name is Aggrey, a Software Developer mainly interested in deep learning. 

I have been thinking about blogging for a while now. I know the benefits of putting work out there but I just couldn't seem to get off the block. Maybe I overthought it. I started one a while ago but it was never consistent. Hopefully, this one will enjoy more success.

This blog will mostly cover deep learning topics. I intend to cover different concepts and various machine learning projects from training to deployment.

I will write about the new things I learn. Sometimes putting your thoughts on paper gives you a better understanding of those things. This blog will act as my notebook; notes of things I'm currently working on or studying. Richard Feynman said If you can’t explain something in simple terms, you don’t understand it. 

This will act as my diary. I will dive deep into personal projects, past and present. It will acts as my portfolio to showcase some of my work and as a project building exercise.

I also intend to discuss some interesting machine learning research papers I am reading. In the process, I will implement a few of them.

I recently noticed that I not only need to deploy my models to web but also to mobile. I have never worked on mobile apps before though. To fill this gap, I decided to learn a new programming language- Flutter (for mobile -Both ios and android). Thanks [Edwin](https://twitter.com/edwinbosire) for the motivation. I hope to document the whole journey. I am looking forward to learning and building some interesting and intelligent apps.

Once in a while am going to talk about startups; the ones I tried, those that failed, what worked, what didn't, startups I admire and lessons I have learned so far.

Finally, I am writing to pay my intellectual debt. I've learnt a great deal from numerous sources off-and-online and I owe it to myself to pay back. If this blog helps you understand a concept, that's a win. If it somehow connects us through projects, consulting or business opportunities, thats a bonus.

A big shout out to everybody who helped me directly or indirectly. Online teachers, courses, blogs, Youtube, ebooks, Github. Jeffery Ways-from codeigniter to Laravel during my PHP days, fast.ai, MIT, Deepmind, UCL, Stanford and many more for their free online courses. I have also learnt a great deal from Open Source projects- PyTorch (Hugging Face, lightning), Nvidia, Deep Graph Library (DGL), Mozilla just to mention a few. Thank you all. Finally, to all those who trust me with their projects, thanks alot.
 
I am really excited about doing this.
